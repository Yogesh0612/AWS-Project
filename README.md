# AWS-Data-Architecture-Design
I took on the challenge set to revolutionize the data architecture. Focused on creating a centralized, cloud-native system on AWS, the objective was to streamline data management, facilitate cross-team collaboration, and integrate predictive analytics to drive smarter investment decisions.

My Approach:

Decentralized Data Woes:

Acknowledging the frustration surrounding the decentralized data structure, I delved into the intricacies to understand the pain points our teams faced in data accessibility and collaboration.
AWS Cloud-Native Prototype:

Leveraging my expertise in AWS, I meticulously crafted a cloud-native prototype, envisioning a seamless flow of data from various sources to a consolidated data warehouse.
Automated Data Ingestion:

My solution ensures easy replication and automation for future data ingestion. The architecture is designed to scale effortlessly as our data demands grow.
Machine Learning Integration:

Recognizing the power of predictive analytics, I seamlessly connected our data architecture to machine learning tools. Jupyter Notebooks and Amazon SageMaker became instrumental in conducting detailed Exploratory Data Analysis and building a robust bankruptcy prediction model.

Project Showcase:

Data Flow Visualization:

My presentation will feature a data flow diagram, a visual representation of the project's architecture. This will vividly illustrate the streamlined path of our data from source to prediction.
Live Demonstration:

Each step of the data flow will be demonstrated live or through screen shares. I will walk through the tools employed, such as AWS Glue for ETL, Amazon Redshift for storage, and Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
Findings:

I'll present two intriguing findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis that could significantly influence investment strategies, showcasing the depth of insights our enhanced data capabilities can provide.
Investment Recommendations:

Based on the predictive model's outcomes, I'll make recommendations on which companies from the 10 considered should be included in our new portfolio.
